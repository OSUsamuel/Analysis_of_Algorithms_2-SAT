<h1>This is my portfolio project for my Analysis of Aloorithms class.</h1>

<p>This has been my favorite class so far.  I loved this intersection of mathematics and computer science.  I can say wholeheartedly that this is the class that has influenced me the most.  In this class were were assigned 4 group projects where we were given a problem and as a result had to come up with a solution, prove the solution, and provide a runtime solution all while presenting our findings in a proffesional document.  This class made me realize how important mathematics were to me and my career and prompted me to add a math major.  Working in a group like this taught me the importance of good communication and how your actions have direct results on your group members. The most important thing I gained from this class was how important presentation and accurate communication of your ideas are.  Before this class I consistently lost points due to not presenting my ideas clearly and failing to explain my results, I can say with full confidence that this class put me on the path of thorough and complete communication and presentation.  </p>
